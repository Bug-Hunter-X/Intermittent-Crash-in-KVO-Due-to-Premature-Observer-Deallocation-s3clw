In Objective-C, a subtle bug can arise from the interaction between KVO (Key-Value Observing) and memory management, specifically when an observer is deallocated before the observed object.  If the observed object attempts to notify the now-deallocated observer, a crash can occur. This is often masked because the crash may not happen immediately and might not consistently reproduce.
